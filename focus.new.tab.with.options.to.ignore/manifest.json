	"description": "This extension will let you choose which web page must be focused (selected) when opening and which should stay in the 'background'. In other words if you open a new tab (eg. by using your middle mouse button) depending on the ignore list of the extension's options page it will either focus (select aka bring it in front of you) on that tab or let you stay on the current tab. This extension is useful when most of the time you want to have the newly opened link selected immediately but there are web pages when you want to open multiple links without focusing on the new tabs immediately eg. when you mass open links/images etc. on certain web sites.",
